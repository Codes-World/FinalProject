# Problem Statements
The core problem that CodeWorld seeks to address is the lack of accessible and effective coding education for learners, particularly those in underprivileged or remote areas. This problem manifests in several ways:

- Students in rural or remote locations often lack access to quality coding education resources.
- High costs associated with coding bootcamps or private tutors make learning to code inaccessible for many.
- Traditional online courses often fail to maintain student interest, resulting in high dropout rates and poor learning outcomes.
- One-size-fits-all educational approaches do not cater to the diverse learning needs and paces of individual students.

# Solution of above problems
To solve this problem I create a CodeWorld online learning platform which try to solve these issue like 

- CodeWorld is available online, allowing students to access it from anywhere with an internet connection.
- CodeWorld platform offers free and low-cost courses to ensure affordability for all students.
- Real-time, customized feedback helps students understand their mistakes and improve their coding skills efficiently.
- Personal Assistant provide like chatbot, students resolve his/her query quickly.
- Creating a collaborative learning environment where students can ask questions, share knowledge, and provide feedback to peers.
